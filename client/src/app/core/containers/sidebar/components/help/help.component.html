  <p>Q: What does this application do?</p>

  <p>Q: Why should I connect my smart home to this mesh network through this app?</p>
  <p>A: By connecting your smart home to the cityâ€™s network, you can control every appliance even when not in the radius, but you can also be notified in the case of a possible burglary, or if you are near one-the same thing applies to every person that is in the radius (e.g. neighbours) of this event.</p>
